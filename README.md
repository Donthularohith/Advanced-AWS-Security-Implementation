# Advanced-AWS-Security-Implementation
This repository contains the implementation of a secure cloud infrastructure in AWS, focusing on medium-to-high-level security aspects. It includes detailed steps to design, secure, monitor, and respond to security incidents in an AWS environment. The project simulates real-world threats and demonstrates automated incident response strategies.  

# SecureCloud: Advanced AWS Security Implementation

## Project Overview
**SecureCloud** is a project focused on designing, implementing, and managing a secure cloud environment using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The project demonstrates advanced security configurations, threat detection, and automated incident response mechanisms through real-world simulations. 

---

## Features
- **Secure Architecture**: Multi-tier setup with Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), public/private subnets, and encrypted communication.
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Least-privilege roles, MFA enforcement, and secure access policies.
- **Data Protection**: End-to-end encryption for S3 buckets and RDS instances, lifecycle policies, and restricted access configurations.
- **Threat Detection**: Real-time monitoring with GuardDuty, AWS Security Hub, and vulnerability scanning using Amazon Inspector.
- **Incident Response**: Automated responses using AWS Lambda for compromised resources and malicious activity.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Centralized logging with AWS CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and AWS Config for compliance tracking and threat analysis.
- **Simulated Attacks**: Demonstrations of S3 data breaches, EC2 compromises, and SQL injection mitigation using WAF rules.

## Prerequisites
- AWS Account with Administrator access.
- Familiarity with basic AWS services (EC2, S3, RDS, IAM).
- AWS CLI installed on your local machine.
- IAM user with MFA enabled.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SecureCloud.git
cd SecureCloud
```

### Step 2: Deploy Secure Architecture
1. Navigate to the `cloudformation/` directory.
2. Use the AWS CLI or AWS Management Console to deploy the CloudFormation templates.
```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file securecloud-template.yaml --stack-name SecureCloudStack
```

### Step 3: Configure IAM and Policies
1. Apply least-privilege IAM roles and policies.
2. Enable MFA for all user accounts.

### Step 4: Enable Monitoring and Logging
1. Enable AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch.
2. Set up AWS Config for resource compliance tracking.

### Step 5: Test Threat Scenarios
1. Use the `incident-simulations/` scripts to simulate:
   - S3 data breaches.
   - EC2 instance compromises.
   - SQL injection attacks on RDS.
2. Monitor findings in GuardDuty and Security Hub.

### Step 6: Automate Incident Response
1. Deploy Lambda functions from `lambda-functions/` to:
   - Isolate compromised EC2 instances.
   - Delete malicious objects in S3.
2. Test the automation by triggering simulated incidents.

## Key Deliverables
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Visualizations of the secure environment.
- **Security Reports**: Documentation of threats detected and mitigation steps.
- **Demo Video**: Walkthrough of the implementation.
- **IaC Templates**: CloudFormation scripts for repeatable deployments.
- **Incident Simulation Scripts**: Tools for testing and learning about cloud security threats.
